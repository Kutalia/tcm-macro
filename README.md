Simple macros for 2023 video game Texas Chainsaw Massacre

## Prerequisites
VLC player is needed to play on and off sounds

## Running
I recommend running project using [`pm2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2):
1. Install pm2 globally `npm install pm2 -g`
2. Run from project directory `pm2 start index.js`
3. Stop the process when done `pm2 stop index.js`

Alternatively, you can build the project using [`nexe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nexe)

# Usage
Press `CAPS Lock` + `E` or `CAPS Lock` + `F` to rapidly press E and F buttons respectively.

### Question of Ethics
As per in [this official blogpost](https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/grapple-reworked-explained) macros are allowed for accessibility use case: 
*Additionally, this mechanic will now have a button cap to ensure that even if a macro is used for accessibility purposes, the button taps per second allowed will still be within the realm of human possibility.* The macro won't give you any significant advantage, it's just for your finger relief.
